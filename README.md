# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Model-Integration-with-Web-Framework-
Credit card fraud is a broad word for theft and fraud perpetrated using or utilizing a credit card at the  moment of payment. As the number of scammers grows every day. Credit cards are used for fraudulent  transactions, and there are several sorts of fraud.  As a result, various techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and Naive Bayes algorithms are utilized to tackle this problem. This transaction is evaluated individually, and whatever works best is carried out. The primary purpose is to detect fraud by filtering the aforementioned strategies in order to achieve a better outcome.

## Objectives
1. To identify and foresee the outcome of unauthorised credit card activity.
2. Analyse a few effective machine learning algorithms, identify the one with the best accuracy, and suggest a model.
3. Add a machine learning model to the web-based framework for better user interface and user experience.
4. Find pertinent dataset features that can aid in the detection of fraud. Identify relevant attributes that capture the patterns and traits of fraudulent transactions by extracting and engineering them.
5. Create a system that can process incoming transactions made with credit cards in real-time and identify whether they are counterfeit or genuine using the used machine learning models
